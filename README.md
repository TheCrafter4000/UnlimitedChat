A mod for Minecraft 1.7.10

# About
This mod removes the annoying character limitation vanilla minecraft has. 
It uses ForgeEssentials on the server for setting a specific limit each player has. 
The permissions for a player's specific limit is _cu.charlimit_. 
There is another permission,  _cu.ignorespam_, which disables the built-in spam filter.
